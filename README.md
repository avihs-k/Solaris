# Solaris
The Ideation- Our original plan was to go with the given problem statements, but after going through all the problem statements, we couldn't relate any feasible solutions that could be implemented in the near future.
We wanted to build something that could be implemented by us and can be easily made available for the masses to use it right away. And there comes our idea for our project inspired from 1972’s sci fi movie ‘SOLARIS’.

The Implementation-We wanted to build an app where people can truly share their stories and receive other perspectives and solutions to their problems from people who’re able to empathise with the user . But the problem is that we have no prior knowledge to web/app development , So we started learning the basics of web dev. With all  the limited time we have and  the basics we learned in the limited time we built a basic prototype website based on our idea . Club members reviewed our product and they gave us  some really good suggestions and raised few questions , so we improved our idea and added new features based on their suggestions and questions raised . 

Its truly been an amazing ODYSSEY
